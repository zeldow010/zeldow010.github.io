        <p><span class="emphasis-text">Rugby Town Concert Band</span> was founded in October 2022 with the aim to provide a <em>'warm and welcoming'</em> society available to anyone who wanted to learn, grow, and be part of a community of likeminded people.</p>
        <p>Our first rehearsal had a group of around 25 musicians who arrived  after seeing advertisements for a new ensemble online. Following the success of the first few rehearsals, the band continued weekley sessions which culminated in the band’s first winter concert hosted at Lawrence Sheriff School in December of 2022.</p>
        <p>Today it has grown into a 30+ member band exhibiting a high-standard of muscianship built by people from a variety of backgrounds and skill levels. Our doors are always open to new people, and if you are interested in joining us please have a look on <a href="/signup.html">our signup page.</a></p>
        <p><em>We welcome players of all age ranges and abilities.</em></p>

        <p><div class="conductor_img"><img src="images/Conductor_Dom_birch.png" alt="A Photo of Conductor: Dominic Birch"></div>Dominic Birch graduated with a Bachelors degree in Music and Sound Recording from the University of York. Here he played in a number of student-run music societies but discovered his interest in the University’s Concert Band, in which he played baritone saxophone, conducted, and later joined back on trumpet. His conducting expertise however also spans to orchestras, having conducted the Concert Orchestra on campus, and also the Gilbert and Sullivan Operatic Society as they were hosted at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in Harrogate in 2021 with their production of “Patience”. When he’s not standing at the front with a baton, he loves getting involved with musical theater productions in the band pit, working on his programming projects, and photography.</p>
