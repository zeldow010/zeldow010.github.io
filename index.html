      <h1 class="welcome">Welcome</h1>
      <p><em>"Hello, my name is Dominic Birch, I'm a Music & Sound Recording Graduate of the University of York. Coming back to Rugby, I wanted to give back to the community by continuing on what I had been doing while away, helping people bring music to the community."</em></p>
      <h2 class="welcome">What to expect</h2>
      <p>First of all, the aim of this group is to meet once a week, and perform in at least three concerts in a year.</p>
      <p>Each rehearsal will be led by myself. We'll have 15 minutes at the start of each rehearsal to warm-up, working on breathing exercises, and give an opportunity to ask any questions. The bulk of the rehearsal will be 2 hours long where we will be working on repertoire (with a 15 minutes break halfway through).</p>
      <p>The society will be built upon a principle of learning as a group, and to try and bring out the best in one another. With an emphasis of being a safe and welcoming space, where questions are welcomed, and stepping outside one's box is encouraged but not forced.</p>
      <p>If any of this sounds interesting to you, whether you have an instrument in a cupboard that you've always wanted a reason to play, or have been playing for a while and want to find a group to challenge you, please sign up using the form below where you'll be invited to the first rehearsal.</p>
      <p>Since we are a new society, you'll be able to have a say in how everything is run, and after the first rehearsal if you feel like it isn't for you, don't fret, we'll remove you from the mailing list and that'll be that.</p>
      <p>Hope to see you there!</p>
