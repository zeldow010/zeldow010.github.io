    <p><span class="emphasis-text">Rugby Town Concert Band (RTCB)</span> is a non-auditioned group of woodwind, brass and percussion players from around the Rugby area. The band is a community-driven, friendly and welcoming group sharing a common goal of making music, improving personal playing skills and bringing music to the local community through tri-annual concerts and other events throughout the year.</p>
    <p>There is an excellent standard of musicianship among players; A repertoire is chosen each “term” by the conductor to try and stretch players’ abilities, while still providing simpler and more accessible tunes. Notable pieces we have played from previous concerts include:
    <em>The Lion King (arr. John Higgins), Alvamar Overture (James Barnes), Bohemian Rhapsody (arr. Philip Sparke), Come Fly With Me (arr. Paul Murtha), and How To Train Your Dragon (arr. Sean O’Loughlin).</em></p>

    <p>Our next concert will be <strong>Saturday 21<sup>st</sup> December 2024</strong> at the wonderful St. George's Church, more information can be found over on our facebook event page.</p>
